The submission from the winning team of Techwars 2025-2026.

The Dashboard ('Hamzaboard') itself acts as a motivational page, giving uplifting quotes and other information.

However, it lost points due to having some static, non-functional elements, such as a temperature and wind speed gauge that served no apparant purpose, while also containing apparantly inaccurate and static information.

It was able to make up for some of these points due to its thoughful and visually appealing design. Despite being made by the winning team, it was not the highest scoring for the round.
